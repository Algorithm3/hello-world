# hello-world

Hello,

Algorithm3 here. I've developed games and applications using C++, Java, C#, .NET, Python, and Unity. Up until now I have created applications as a hobbyist but am hoping to get into software development professionally. I would like to share some code and hope to receive advice from the community.
